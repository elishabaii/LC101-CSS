# LC101-CSS
Starter code for teaching fundamentals of CSS. To be used as an in class lecture alongside chapter 21, https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-professional-web-dev/chapters/css/index.html

## Cloning the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/farrellw/LC101-CSS.git
cd LC101-CSS
```

## Instructions:
We will work through a few examples of CSS using the `example.html` page in class.
In small chunks, we will build `assignment.html` until it resembles the `.png` found at `goal/finishedposter.png`
As you are working, you can always check your work by opening the html page, e.g. `open example.html`
